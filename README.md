# Collimator

## Reflection & Introspection for PostgreSQL Databases

### What is Collimator?

Collimator is a JavaScript library that uses reflection techniques to introspect PostgreSQL databases:

- Enumerate table names and identify primary keys
- Generate [JSON Schema v4][jsonschema] for a given table
- Extract table relationship information using foreign key constraints

[jsonschema]: http://json-schema.org

### Design Motivations

Traditionally, programmers have defined their schema by writing model definitions in application code. Some kind of migration tool then transforms this schema into SQL, and applies it against a database.

Collimator allows this pattern to be reversed. The database now becomes the canonical source of your application's schema and relationship metadata.

### Installation

Install as a dependency in your application with `npm install --save collimator`.

### Usage

Enumerate table names and primary keys with `collimator.tables(db)`.

Generate JSON Schema with `collimator.schema(db, 'tableName')`.

Extract relationship information with `collimator.relationships(db, 'tableName')`.

The top-level Collimator functions (`tables`, `schema` and `relationships`) accept a [pg-promise][pg-promise] connection as their first argument, and return a promise. For further guidance, please refer to the [examples][examples] and [API Documentation][api-docs].

### Prior Art

The approach to schema extraction is inspired by [DDL.js][js-ddl]. Collimator's implementation is currently not as robust as DDL.js, and only targets PostgreSQL (an intentional design decision, and unlikely to change). However, Collimator supports the extraction of relationship information.
